Container Orchestration :-

When you have many containers running across different machines, manually managing them becomes difficult. Container orchestration tools help by:

  Automating deployment & scaling 📈

  Managing networking between containers 🌐

  Handling failures & self-healing 🔄

  Load balancing traffic between containers ⚖️

🔹 How It Works?

1️⃣ Deployment
    Define how many containers should run and where
    Specify configurations (e.g., environment variables, storage)

2️⃣ Scaling & Load Balancing
    Automatically add/remove containers based on traffic
    Distribute requests using ingress controllers

3️⃣ Self-Healing
    If a container fails, it gets restarted automatically
    If a machine goes down, workloads shift elsewhere

4️⃣ Networking & Service Discovery
    Assign internal/external IPs to services
    Enable container-to-container communication
